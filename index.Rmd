## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to...
criminal justice. Specifically, I hope to look at data from states with the death penalty and those without to see whether or not capital punishment lowers crime rates. I am interested in learning how to create an accurate data set for this project, given that controlled experiments are more difficult in the social sciences.
